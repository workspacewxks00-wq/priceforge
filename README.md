# PriceForge

Backend-first competitor price tracking tool.

Built with Lovable for the frontend — I'm primarily a backend developer.

## What it does
- Scrapes competitor prices based on a config file
- Exports data to CSV / Excel
- No UI, no subscriptions, one-time purchase

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py --config config/targets.json
